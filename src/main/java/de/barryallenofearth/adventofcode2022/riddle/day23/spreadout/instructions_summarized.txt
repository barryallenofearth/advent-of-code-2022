two phases for each elf:
1) where to go
2) move

Option 1
1) no adjacent elf
2) don't move

Option 2
1) no elf is northish
2) propose move north

Option 3
1) no elf is southish
2) propose move south

Option 4
1) no elf is westish
2) propose move west

Option 5
1) no elf is eastish
2) propose move east

all elves with only field proposed move to that position, otherwise don't move

after moving -> cycle first consideration direction => now first option is option 3, then 4, then 5, then 1

end if no elf needs to move anymore

solution: after 10 rounds find smallest rect to contain all elves and count empty fields!
